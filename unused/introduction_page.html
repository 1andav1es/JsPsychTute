      This is a short psychological study investigating how people read sprint
      orienteering maps. It involves the following steps:<br />

      <ol>
        <li>We ask for your consent.</li>

        <li>We ask for demographic information.</li>

        <li>If you are new to orienteering we give you some information on reading sprint 
        orienteering maps.</li>

        <li>We then check to ensure that you understand the map symbols and if you don't, 
        you get another opertunity to look through the introductory information.</li>

        <li>The study then explains how to do the task in detail. Then we do the experiment itself.</li>

        <li>At the end, we'll show you a summary of your results and give you the option
        to identify yourself so we can email you information on the results we obtain.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The total time taken should be about 20 minutes. Please <u>don't</u> use the
      "back" button on your browser or close the window until you reach the end. Doing
      this is very likely to break the experiment which means that I will loose my data
      and you may not get a copy of your results. If something does go wrong, please
      contact me, and I will do what I can to fix it! When you're ready to begin, click
      on the 'Start' button below.</p>

      <p>If you have had a go at this before and want to see what has changed from last
      time look <a href="./doc/changelog.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, if you would
      like to see what is on the 'to do list' then you might want to look at <a href=
      "./doc/todo.pdf" target="_blank">this</a>.  Finally, if Ian has given you a 16
      character code for a particular experiment, paste it into the box below then click 'Start'.</p>
