      Because you have been here before the process is a bit simpler:<br />

      <ol>
        <li>We don't need your 'consent' or your demographic information.</li>

        <li>We don't train or test your map reading ability.</li>

        <li>Each set of trial has an introduction followed by a number of real trials. Note 
        that you see the map for a shorter time, (because you are experienced).  If you find 
        you aren't sure of the correct answer, just guess (It may surprise you how often you 
        are correct!).</li>

        <li>At the end, we'll show you a summary of your results.  If you can, send me a quick email when 
        you are done and I can update you on what we have learnt so far.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>As before, the total time taken should be about 20 minutes. Please <u>don't</u> use the
      "back" button on your browser or close the window until you reach the end.  Doing
      this is very likely to break the experiment which means that I will loose my data
      and you may get asked to do it again. If something does go wrong, please
      contact me, and I will do what I can to fix it! When you're ready to begin, click
      on the "start" button below.</p>
